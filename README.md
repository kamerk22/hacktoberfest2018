# What is Hacktoberfest?
[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) is a month-long celebration in open source community. It motivates open source contributors as well as first-time contributors. For the first time contributor, it's a bit hard or overwhelming but the fun part is "Everyone is welcome"
